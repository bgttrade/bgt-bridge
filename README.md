# BGT bridge

## Introduction

- This bridge supports BGT between Polygon and Arbitrum.

## Deployment

1. The first step is to deploy cross chain contracts
2. Secondly, start the relayer

## Relayer

1. After the contract is deployed, the relayer is required to complete the whole cross chain operation.
2. The relayer is responsible for monitoring the cross chain events generated by the bridge contract and voting the
   cross chain data in the manager contract.
3. After a successful vote, the manager will generate a vote event.
4. The relayer listens to the voting success event, and then calls the bridge to complete the subsequent operations on
   the target chain.

## Usage

- User calls bridgeOut for cross chain
